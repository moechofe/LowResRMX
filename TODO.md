    What is missing right now?

    1. The ability to make a particle designer
    2. ?

    3. Proposal

        I can keep the appearence stored in data, I like it.
        I should try to change the emitter data and use variables

            EMITTER eid [ON x,y] [DATA a,s,o,i,c,r,sx,sy,e,n,d,p]

        With `a`,`s`,`o`,`i`,`c`,`r`,`sx`,`sy`,`e`,`n`,`d` and `p` are all optional.

    4. Proposal

        If the library is simulating actually external chip, it can hold additional internal memory modifiable using commands.

- [ ] flutter_app: Can I prevent user to hide the keyboard?

    No, but I can setup a special use case for when INPUT is used, has it actually block the game.

- [x] core: Add a function to test  the keyboard visibility
- [ ] core: Remove pause feature. Or make it usefull for dev. Trace the "paused" message instead of in center of the screen.
- [-] flutter_app: enable ctrl/shift/insert... shortcut for cut copy past.

    Cannot be done, the mapping for shortcut to action has been implement in the wrong way, preventing to map multiple shortcut to the same action (intent)
    See: https://github.com/reqable/re-editor/blob/100e56708ff3dc93955e9e59c053aff944d7c193/lib/src/code_shortcuts.dart#L64

- [x] flutter_app: Update re_editor.
- [-] flutter_app: No context menu available for the text editor?

    Re-Editor implements the control logic of the desktop context menu and the mobile long-press selection menu, but does not provide a default UI. Developers need to implement the SelectionToolbarController interface and setup it through toolbarController.

        CodeEditor(
            toolbarController: _MyToolbarController(),
        );

    The example show in re_editor repository do not work on Android but on linux.

    I probably need to implement a custom toolbar above the keyboard instead. I suspect showMenu to remove the focus on the editor and then, it selecte the whole line instead of the selection made by the user. Why did it act differently on Android and Linux?, I dunno.

- [ ] flutter_app: How to mesure performance and battery consumption?

- [ ] client_app: Restore previously pushed route.
- [x] client_app: Allow to open the app using a file.
